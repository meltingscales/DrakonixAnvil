# prompt
- make sure to view "/home/henrypost/Git/VirtualMachineConfigs/ansible/minecraft" for inspiration.
- read README.md

## ideas
- hook into `stdin` for java process, expose it to the rust frontend
  - perhaps use `tee` or `screen` for this? how does enterprise do it?
- support backup to google drive, opinionated `~/DrakonixAnvilMinecraftBackup/**`

- how to help n00bs port forward?
  - remote `nc` to tell you if tcp/12345 is exposed? jeb util?
